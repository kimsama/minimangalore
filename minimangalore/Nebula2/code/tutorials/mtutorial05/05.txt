tutorial 05 : introduction to physics simulation

nota : fall back to one simple state game in order to have a code simpler

what new here :
introduction of physics model : control the opelblitz
xml description files (2 included)
physics property
enabling physics simulation
use of a simple/primitive input method 

you MUST read the ode documentation.

Still no full documentation but I add a lot of comment, should be ok for now :-)

THIS IS STILL BETA. Thinks not properly working (yet) : contact/friction ; tuning of the xml file ; pb with lighting. So, if you got answers, post on the forum !! (because I fucking don't get what's wrong !)

A+
