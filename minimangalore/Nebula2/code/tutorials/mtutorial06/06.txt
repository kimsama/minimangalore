tutorial 06 : "damage" by texture

base : tutorial 03 (just to keep things simple :-) )

just few lines to explain how to perform damage level(s) on a model by texture. (or just change texture at run time...)
Of course this must be link to physics colision, and must be used with a model with more than 3 meshes ! (else it's kind of
90's game ...)
