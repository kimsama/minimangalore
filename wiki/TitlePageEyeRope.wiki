{{{ 
The cable is divided into n segments. I use capped cylinders as geoms.
To connect them, I tried different joints *(ball&socket, universal & hinge2)*.
Because the cable needs to have a material attribute which describes the maximum angle it can be bend, I use hinge2 now. With the parameters dParamLoStop and dParamHiStop I can control how far the cable can be bend. 
Using an AMotor dry friction in the joints is modelled (as described in the
documentation). To slow down the cable, while it's hanging down and swinging, the velocity of the bodies is taken each frame, a negative friction of it is added to the body (again, as described in the documentation :)
